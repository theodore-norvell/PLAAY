 Many user actions such as keypresses, click on palette buttons, and drag and drop from the palette create compound nodes; i.e., nodes that can have children.
 Examples:
    Pressing the + * - / _ \ 0 . or ? keys.
    Dragging the ?, while, lambda, varDecl, call or callWorld pallet items onto the view of the tree.
    Clicking on any of the same buttons.

 Each of these actions can be interpreted as replacing or engulfing the current selection.  The rules to decide are these
    * If both edits would fail, no change to the tree.
    * If only one edit would succeed, that edit is chosen.
    * If the current selection is empty, replace is preferred.
    * If the current selection is not empty, engulf is preferred.

These rules are easily expressed by the edit
    compose(
          alt( compose( selectionIsAllPlaceHolder, replace ),
               engulf,
               replace),
          opt( tabForwardEdit ) )
where
   * alt, opt, and compose are as defined in the edits module,
   * selectionIsAllPlaceHolder is an edit that fails if some node in the selection
     is not a placeholer and that makes no change otherwise,
   * replace is an edit that replaces the current selection with the new tree,
   * engulf is an edit that engulfs the current selection with the new tree.
   * tabForwardEdit is an edit that does what the tab key does.

Details of replace. Suppose the target (i.e., the argument to apply) is t and the template
to be inserted is another selection s.  Let ps be the sequence of nodes selected by t.
The ps in t are replaced by s (ala InsertChildrenEdit) to make a selection t'.
The result is t'.  Note that the root of s will be the only selected node in t'

Details of engulf.  An engulf can be thought of as three edit steps.  Suppose the target
(i.e., the argument to apply) is t and the template to be inserted is another selection s.
Let ps be the sequence of nodes selected by t.
*  First ps is inserted (ala InsertChildrenEdit) into s to make a selection s'.
*  If the first step fails, the whole edit fails.
*  Second the root of s' is inserted into t (ala InsertChildrenEdit) to make a
   selection t'.  t' should have one selected, node, corresponding to the root of s'.
*  The second step fails, the whole edit fails.
*  Third, the selection is adjusted so that it is a point selection to the right of where
   the engulfed nodes ended up.
*  The result is t'' if the RightEdit succeeds and is t' if the RightEdit fails.

Details of tabForwardEdit.  A tabForwardEdit repeatedly moves the selection right in previsit
order at least once.  (It fails if that first move can't be made and succeeds otherwise.)
It stops moving the selection right when the selection is either a point selection
corresponding to a dropzone or a selection of size one containing a placeholder node.
It also stops when there are no more moves to the right possible.  However, there is
one exception to this simple plan: It does not stop on a dropzone when if there is a
placeholder with the same parent immediately to the right.  The reasoning here is
that if there is one place holder just to the the right, it's probably there to]
represent a place to put something, so it's probably better to put something where
the placeholder is than where the dropzone is.  For example, if the selection is
    callWorld[+]( !var[x]^, ExpPH) ,
it's better for the tab to take us to a selection
    callWorld[+]( var[x], !ExpPH^ )
than to a selection
    callWorld[+]( var[x], !^ ExpPH )

Details of space.  A space expands the current selection by selecting the parent, unless
the parent is the root, in which case there is no change.
