Einstein</div><div><br/></div><div>[...] makes you realize that science is fun and science is play.  -- Oliver Sacks</div><div><br/></div><div>Thus, wherever playfulness prevails, there is always a surprising element, surpassing mere repetition or habituation, and at its best suggesting some virgin chance conquored, some divine leeway shared. -- Erik H. Ericson</div><div><br/></div><div>There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about, It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you play with them! -- Richard P. Feynman</div><div><br/></div><div>Q: <strong>What is the play instinct?</strong>
</div><div><p/></div><div>A: It is the instinct for order, the need for rules that, if broken, spoil the game, create uncertainty and irresolution. “Play is tense,” says Johan Huizinga. “It is the element of tension and solution that governs all solitary games of skill.” Without play, there would be no Picasso. Without play, there is no experimentation. Experimentation is the quest for answers.  — Paul Rand<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I use the term “play,” but I mean coping with the problems of form and content, weighing relationships, establishing priorities. Every problem of form and content is different, which dictates that the rules of the game are different, too. — Paul Rand<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
